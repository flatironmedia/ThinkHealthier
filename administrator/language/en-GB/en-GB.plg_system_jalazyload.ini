PLG_JALAZYLOAD_XML_DESCRIPTION="<p>JA Lazyload plugin for Joomla. Lazy Load is a jQuery plugin written in JavaScript. <br>  It delays loading of images in long web pages. <br>  Images outside of viewport (visible part of web page) wont be loaded before user scrolls to them. <br>  This is opposite of image preloading.</p><p>Using Lazy Load on long web pages containing many large images makes the page load faster. <br>  Browser will be in ready state after loading visible images. In some cases it can also help to reduce server load.</p><p><a href="_QQ_"http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload"_QQ_" title="_QQ_""_QQ_">Lazy Load</a> is provided by by Mika Tuupola, originally inspired by <a href="_QQ_"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/imageloader/"_QQ_" title="_QQ_""_QQ_">YUI ImageLoader</a>  Utility by Matt Mlinac .</p>"
