<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Clinton Edges Trump on Health Care, Survey Finds]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[But <i>HealthDay/Harris Poll</i> finds support for either candidate in this area is far from overwhelming]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[<b>By Dennis Thompson</b><br><i>HealthDay Reporter</i>]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>MONDAY, Aug. 22, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- More Americans trust Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to do a good job on health care issues than Republican rival Donald Trump, a new <i>HealthDay/Harris Poll</i> reports.</p>

<p>However, neither candidate has earned the confidence of a majority of U.S. adults when it comes to health care, the poll found.</p>

<p>Forty-six percent of adults think Clinton will do an overall good job with health care policy, compared to 33 percent who feel the same way about Trump.</p>

<p>Clinton also received more support regarding specific aspects of health care:</p><ul>

<li>37 percent thought she would do an excellent or good job making health care affordable, compared with 26 percent for Trump.</li>
<li>36 percent believed she could improve the quality of both health care and health insurance, compared with 26 percent and 28 percent, respectively, for Trump.</li>
<li>48 percent are a great deal or somewhat confident she'll do a good job handling both Medicare and Medicaid, compared with 35 percent and 32 percent, respectively, for Trump.</li>
<li>45 percent are confident she'll manage the Veteran's health care system (VA) well, compared with 39 percent for Trump.</li></ul>

<p>The poll involved 2,027 adults and was conducted online in English between Aug. 3 and 5.</p>

<p>Overall, support appears tepid for both candidates when it comes to health care, said Humphrey Taylor, chairman emeritus of the Harris Poll.</p> 

<p>"While the public is somewhat less negative about Clinton, the most striking result is how negative attitudes are to both candidates," Taylor said. "Less than 50 percent of the public give either of them a positive response in any of the questions."</p>

<p>This weak support is particularly interesting for Clinton, given her long track record on health care issues. Clinton led the first attempt at health care reform back in the 1990s, during the presidency of her husband, Bill Clinton.</p>

<p>"Given that Clinton has such a long experience in health care policy -- more than 20 years -- and that Trump has virtually none, it is perhaps surprising that she only has a rather modest advantage on health care issues," Taylor said.</p>

<p>Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies for the conservative Cato Institute, agreed.</p>

<p>"Majorities of Americans believe neither Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump will make health care better," Cannon said. "They're probably right. This is a vote of no confidence in both candidates."</p>

<p>Both candidates are saddled with high overall negatives, and that could be influencing how people respond when asked about specific policy questions, said Karlyn Bowman, a senior fellow and research coordinator for the conservative American Enterprise Institute.</p>

<p>"Both of these candidates have very high unfavorable ratings, and I think these ratings on health care may reflect the general negativity there is regarding both candidates," Bowman said.</p>

<p>At the same time, Americans typically place health care high on the list of issues important to them, and it's telling that a majority trust neither candidate on this crucial matter, Bowman said.</p>

<p>"They think health care has become more expensive, and they aren't confident that either candidate can make health care affordable for you and me," she said.</p>

<p>Despite the lack of majority support, it shouldn't be overlooked that Clinton is much more trusted than Trump on health care policy, said Ron Pollack, founding executive director of the health consumer advocacy group Families USA.</p>

<p>"There is a clear difference at least in terms of greater confidence about her role in health care than Donald Trump," Pollack said. "That's not surprising, because she has focused on health care for decades and really understands how policy can make a huge difference for consumers. Trump really is a neophyte in this area."</p>

<p>The poll results also show that this election is in part a referendum on the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the health care reform measure that is the centerpiece of President Barack Obama's term in office, Pollack said.</p>

<p> More than three in five Americans (62 percent) would trust Hillary Clinton to keep the ACA, while more than half (56 percent) would trust Donald Trump to repeal it, according to the results.</p>

<p>"My theory is that by the latter part of 2017, the debate about the ACA will be over," Pollack said. "If Trump wins, the key architecture of the ACA will be repealed, and there will be enormous restructuring of Medicaid. On the other hand, if Secretary Clinton were to win, it puts an end to that debate because everyone will realize it's futile to talk about repealing the statute."</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Unhappy at Work in Your 20s, Unhealthy in Your 40s?]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[How young adults feel about their careers might affect them physically, mentally by middle-age, study finds]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[<b>By Alan Mozes</b><br><i>HealthDay Reporter</i>]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>MONDAY, Aug. 22, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Millennials, take heed: Job dissatisfaction in your 20s or 30s can undermine your health by mid-life, new research suggests.</p>

<p>But really rewarding work may pay health dividends.</p>

<p>"Those who are, on average, very satisfied versus satisfied tend to have better health in their 40s," said study lead author Jonathan Dirlam. He is a doctoral candidate in the department of sociology at Ohio State University.</p>

<p>By their 40s, disenchanted workers had worse mental health. They were more likely to suffer from routine sleep trouble and anxiety compared with satisfied or increasingly satisfied participants, the study found. </p>

<p> Seth Kaplan, an associate professor in industrial/organizational psychology at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., said, "We know that there are some major job-related factors that contribute to poor psychological health." </p>

<p>According to Kaplan, who wasn't involved in the study, "Having an abusive supervisor, not having control over one's work, and having to worry about losing one's job -- and the corresponding financial repercussions -- are among the big ones." </p>

<p>Kaplan added, "If at all possible, try to avoid jobs with those characteristics." </p>

<p>For the study, Dirlam's team analyzed survey responses from more than 6,400 men and women participating in a long-running study that began in 1979. Between the ages of 25 and 39, these adults were asked annually whether they liked or disliked their jobs.</p>

<p>Answers were correlated with mental and physical health outcomes when participants entered their 40s.</p>

<p>Roughly 45 percent consistently expressed "low" job satisfaction. On average, Dirlam said, this reflected relative dissatisfaction, rather than outright dislike for their work.</p>

<p>By contrast, 15 percent of respondents consistently noted they were "happy" with their jobs.</p>

<p>In addition, nearly one-quarter indicated that their satisfaction with work got worse over time, while 17 percent said they became more satisfied, the findings showed.</p>

<p>Once the participants reached their 40s, mental health status was gauged in terms of depression, sleep trouble and anxiety.</p>

<p>Overall physical health was also ranked, along with incidence of high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer, arthritis, heart disease, chronic lung disease, back and leg trouble, stomach and liver complications, and anemia.</p>

<p>The researchers found that physical health appeared to suffer among those who consistently expressed low satisfaction with work or whose satisfaction fell over time.</p>

<p>These people reported more difficulty with certain issues, such as back pain and cold frequency. However, the researchers saw no impact on their overall ability to function physically, or in their risk for serious illnesses such as diabetes or cancer.</p>

<p>Nor was consistently low job satisfaction or falling satisfaction linked with a greater likelihood for developing depression.</p>

<p>However, these dissatisfied workers were more likely to be in poorer mental health overall, the findings showed.</p>

<p>The research team theorized that mental health difficulties could actually trigger more physical health complications as participants' age.</p>


<p>But no negative impact on physical or mental well-being was seen among those who reported greater satisfaction with work over time, the study authors said.</p>


<p>Still, the investigators did not examine health status after age 49. They also acknowledged that the relationship is complex and said it's not possible to establish cause and effect.</p>

<p>For example, "[early] health problems may lead to lower levels of job satisfaction rather than the reverse," the authors said.</p>

<p>Dirlan noted that "those in manual labor jobs may have lower job satisfaction and increased physical health problems as a result of their jobs in later life. We are unable to rule out this possibility."</p>

<p>For those desiring more satisfaction from their work, Kaplan highlighted the concept of "job crafting." This embraces the notion "that we can, to some extent, objectively and subjectively change our jobs to make them more meaningful."</p>

<p>Dirlam and his colleagues were  scheduled to present their findings Monday in Seattle at a meeting of the American Sociological Association. Data and conclusions presented at meetings are usually considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[No More Than 6 Teaspoons of Added Sugars a Day for Kids]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[New guidelines aim to help improve children's overall diet, health]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>MONDAY, Aug. 22, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Children and teens should consume less than six teaspoons of added sugars a day, a new American Heart Association statement advises.</p>

<p>"Our target recommendation is the same for all children between the ages of 2 and 18, to keep it simple for parents and public health advocates," statement lead author Dr. Miriam Vos said in a heart association news release. </p>

<p>Added sugars are any sugars, including table sugar, fructose and honey, used in processing and preparing foods or beverages, added to foods at the table, or eaten separately.</p>

<p>"For most children, eating no more than six teaspoons of added sugars per day is a healthy and achievable target," Vos explained. She is a nutrition scientist and associate professor of pediatrics at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta. </p>

<p>The statement also said children younger than 2 years should not consume foods or beverages with added sugars at all. In addition, children and teens aged 2 to 18 should consume no more than 8 ounces of sugar-sweetened drinks a week.</p>

<p>The statement, published Aug. 22 in the journal <i>Circulation</i>, is based on a review of available scientific research on how sugar affects children's health.</p>

<p>Regular consumption of foods and drinks high in added sugars can lead to high blood pressure, obesity and diabetes, which increase the risk of heart disease.</p>

<p>"Children who eat foods loaded with added sugars tend to eat fewer healthy foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains and low-fat dairy products that are good for their heart health," Vos noted.</p>

<p>"There has been a lack of clarity and consensus regarding how much added sugar is considered safe for children, so sugars remain a commonly added ingredient in foods and drinks, and overall consumption by children remains high -- the typical American child consumes about triple the recommended amount of added sugars," she said.</p>


<p>Starting in July 2018, food products sold in the United States will have to list the amount of added sugars on the Nutrition Facts Panel.</p>

<p>"Until then, the best way to avoid added sugars in your child's diet is to serve mostly foods that are high in nutrition, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, lean meat, poultry and fish, and to limit foods with little nutritional value," Vos said.</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Mouse Study Suggests Antibiotics in Kids Might Help Spur Type 1 Diabetes]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[Whether link applies to humans isn't clear, researchers say]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[<b>By Serena Gordon</b><br><i>HealthDay Reporter</i>]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>MONDAY, Aug. 22, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Repeated treatments with antibiotics were linked to the development of type 1 diabetes in mice, a new study finds. </p>

<p>Researchers gave the mice antibiotic doses equivalent to what kids receive to treat something like an ear infection.</p>

<p>After three antibiotic treatments, the researchers saw an "accelerated and enhanced rate of type 1 diabetes in the mice," said Dr. Martin Blaser, a professor of translational medicine and microbiology at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City. </p>

<p>Blaser explained that antibiotics led to a change in the microbiome in the gut -- or intestinal bacteria. Those changes resulted in other changes, including alterations in immune system cells called T-cells. That, in turn, led to increased inflammation in the insulin-producing islet cells of the pancreas, he said. </p>

<p>So, do all of these changes occur in the same way in humans?  It's too soon to know for sure, though Blaser said other research suggests that kids with autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, have an altered microbiome.</p>

<p>Jessica Dunne, director of discovery research for JDRF, formerly called the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, said these changes in the microbiota may play some role in type 1 diabetes, but it's not yet clear what that role is.</p>

<p>"We still don't know how or why type 1 diabetes develops. But there's likely no <i>one</i> smoking gun that we can point to as the cause of type 1 diabetes," Dunne said. </p>

<p>Both Blaser and Dunne said these findings shouldn't cause parents to shun antibiotics altogether. Blaser said to rely on your child's doctor to let you know when antibiotics are necessary and when they are optional. </p>

<p>"We used to think antibiotics were safe, with no side effects. Now we know, everything has some consequences," said Dunne.</p>

<p>"But still, there is a time and a place for antibiotics," she added.</p>

<p>Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that develops when the body mistakenly attacks the insulin-producing cells in the body, according to JDRF. This leaves someone with type 1 diabetes without enough insulin to properly use the carbohydrates in foods as fuel.</p>

<p>Although the exact reasons why the disease occurs remain elusive, researchers do know the disease has genetic and environmental factors. </p>

<p>Since World War II, type 1 diabetes has doubled every 20 to 25 years. Increases occurring that quickly are happening too fast to be caused by genetic changes, Blaser said.</p>

<p>So, he looked for other factors that had also increased dramatically after World War II. One such factor was the use of antibiotics, he said.</p>

<p>"Antibiotics are being used so much. On average, by age 10, a child will have had 10 courses of antibiotics," Blaser said.</p>

<p>The current study looked at the effects of antibiotics on non-obese mice that were susceptible to type 1 diabetes. Dunne said these mice are the best animal model researchers have for type 1 diabetes.</p>

<p>Researchers used very young mice -- Blaser said they'd be similar in age to a 6- month to 1-year old child.</p>

<p>The mice were given pulsed antibiotic therapy (three doses at different time periods); a continuous but very low dose of antibiotics or no antibiotics.</p>

<p>Mice exposed to the pulsed therapy were twice as likely to develop type 1 diabetes compared to mice that got no antibiotics, the study found.</p>

<p>The researchers also transferred some of the changed gut microbiota from the antibiotic-exposed mice to two other groups of mice. This increased the risk of type 1 diabetes in one group, but not the other. The researchers said more study is needed to understand why.</p>

<p>Blaser plans to continue his research. The next step is more mouse studies, and eventually following families with a high risk for type 1, he said. </p>

<p>The hope is to come up with a way to prevent or treat the disease at some point in the future.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Dunne said it's a good idea to be "cautious about what we're giving to ourselves and our children. For example, antibiotics won't help a viral infection. We need to be smart about when we use antibiotics." </p>

<p>The study findings were published in the Aug. 22 issue of <i>Nature Microbiology</i>.</p>

<BYLINE><![CDATA[]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>MONDAY, Aug. 22, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- It's only a matter of time after school begins before parents have to deal with a child who doesn't feel well enough to go.</p>

<p>If your child complains of a headache, he or she probably isn't faking, said Dr. Jennifer Caudle. She is an assistant professor of family medicine at Rowan University School of Osteopathic Medicine in Stratford, N.J.</p>

<p>Stress, lack of sleep or changes in diet can all contribute to headaches in children at the start of a new school year, she  said in a university news release.</p>

<p>Most headaches can be treated with over-the-counter (OTC) medications. Parents should seek medical attention if their child has a headache related to injury. </p>

<p>Medical attention is also needed if a child complaining of headache has a fever and stiff neck, or if vision is affected, the headache doesn't go away or if it causes the child to miss school or other activities, she added.</p>

<p>When dealing with any type of illness, "parents need to be able to quickly assess whether their child is well enough for school, should stay home or needs to see a physician," Caudle said.</p>

<p>When children have a cold, it's generally best for them to rest, she suggested. Coughing, sneezing, runny nose, sinus pressure, mild sore throat and body aches not only make it hard to concentrate in the classroom, but a child may also spread the cold virus to others.</p>

<p>Kids who have a fever should definitely stay home, Caudle said. She advises parents to give child-strength OTC medications and to call a doctor if symptoms worsen or fail to improve. It's also time to call a doctor when an already high fever rises or continues for more than 24 hours.</p>

<p>If you suspect your child has pink eye (conjunctivitis), which is easily spread, keep him or her home. Call your doctor for treatment, typically antibiotic eye drops. The doctor will let you know when your child can return to school.</p>

<p>Children who vomit or have diarrhea should not go to school. They can become dehydrated quickly, so discuss symptoms with your doctor. Gradually introduce clear liquids and bland foods. It's especially important to contact your doctor if vomiting or diarrhea persists for 24 hours, if the child has a fever, or there is blood in the vomit or stool, Caudle said.</p>

<p>"When in doubt about the seriousness of your child's illness, or if your child has underlying illnesses that make them particularly susceptible to the conditions above, always err on the side of caution and contact your child's physician for advice," Caudle said.</p>

<BLURB><![CDATA[Philadelphia study found 15 percent who underwent physical exams also had high blood pressure]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>MONDAY, Aug. 22, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Student-athletes may be more popular than teens who don't play sports, but they're no more fit.</p>

<p>Turns out they have similar rates of obesity and high blood pressure as non-athletes, a new study finds.</p>    

<p>Researchers analyzed data from 2,700 student-athletes in Philadelphia who received free preseason physicals over four years from the non-profit Athlete Health Organization. The physicals are done to identify students who might be at risk for injury, illness or death.</p>

<p>"We founded the Athlete Health Organization to promote safe sports activity but we can also use these events to evaluate the overall health of this population," said Dr. David Shipon. He is a cardiologist at Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals in Philadelphia and CEO of the sports organization. </p>

<p>"This is our first research study and we found alarmingly high rates of obesity and high blood pressure readings among adolescent student-athletes," he added in a university news release.</p>

<p>Twenty percent of athletes were overweight; 24 percent were obese; and nearly 15 percent had higher-than-normal blood pressure. Those rates are similar to the general teen population, according to the study authors.</p>

<p>"Although the general presumption is that athletics and activity should help with weight and blood pressure control, our study suggests that student-athletes in Philadelphia are suffering from these conditions at the same alarming rate as their peers who do not sign up for school sports," study first author Dr. Jill Kropa said in the news release. Kropa was a sports medicine fellow at Thomas Jefferson University during the study.</p>

<p>The report was published online Aug. 17 in <i>The Journal of Pediatrics</i>.</p>

<BODY><![CDATA[<p>MONDAY, Aug. 22, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Research in mice shows it may be possible to reverse brain damage after a stroke.</p>

<p>"No one in the stroke field has ever shown this, so I believe this is going to be the gold standard for future studies," said senior study author Berislav Zlokovic, director of the Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute at the University of Southern California.</p>

<p>The experimental treatment combined transplanted neural stem cells with a protein called 3K3A-APC, the scientists said.</p>

<p>In mice, the protein triggered the stem cells to become functioning neurons. But animal research does not always pan out in humans.</p>

<p>"We showed that 3K3A-APC helps the grafted stem cells convert into neurons and make structural and functional connections with the host's nervous system," Zlokovic said in a university news release. Zlokovic is also a scientific founder of ZZ Biotech, a company that is developing treatments with the protein used in this trial.</p>

<p> Jim Koenig, a program director at the U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), said that the "study could pave the way for a potential breakthrough in how we treat people who have experienced a stroke." NINDS funded the research.</p>

<p>"If the therapy works in humans, it could markedly accelerate the recovery of these patients," Koenig added.  </p>

<p>Zlokovic and his team now want to conduct a clinical trial to test whether this therapy is effective in people with strokes. If it's successful, they plan to test the therapy in treating other neurological conditions, such as spinal cord injuries.</p>

<p>In an ongoing clinical trial funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, 3K3A-APC alone is being given to patients within a few hours of ischemic stroke (blocked blood flow to the brain), to determine if the protein can help protect against brain damage.</p>

<p>Close to 800,000 Americans suffer a stroke every year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>

<p>More than 70 percent of those who survive a stroke have to live with muscle weakness or paralysis, said study co-lead author Yaoming Wang, a senior research associate at the Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute.</p>

<p>"The need for an efficacious, practical and late treatment of stroke remains unmet," Wang said in the news release. "Regenerative medicine with stem cells holds great promise for the treatment of stroke."</p>

<p>The study was published Aug. 22 in the journal <i>Nature Medicine</i>.</p>

<BODY><![CDATA[<p>MONDAY, Aug. 22, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Power outages can be more than an inconvenience. They can cause problems with your food and water that could put your family's health at risk.</p>

<p>If the power is out for less than four hours, food in your refrigerator and freezer will be safe to eat, but you should keep the appliance doors closed, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.</p>

<p>If the power is out more than four hours, pack milk and other dairy products, meat, fish, eggs, gravy and spoilable leftovers into a cooler with ice. A freezer that is full will hold food safely for 48 hours, while a half-full freezer will hold food safely for up to 24 hours, the CDC said in a news release. Avoid opening the freezer door.</p>

<p>Before you use any food, check its temperature with a food thermometer. Toss out anything with a temperature above 40 degrees Fahrenheit. </p>

<p>Power outages also may cause water purification systems to stop working, the agency warned. If that happens, safe sources of water for drinking, cooking and personal hygiene include bottled, boiled or treated water.</p>

<p>Make sure bottled water is from a safe source. If you aren't sure, boil or treat bottled water before you use it. Boiling water for one minute is the best way to kill harmful bacteria and parasites, the CDC advised.</p>

<p>If necessary, you can use disinfectants such as iodine or chlorine dioxide tablets to make water safer to drink, according to the CDC. Follow package directions. </p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[TV Ratings for Parents Let Violence, Drinking Slip Through]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[Industry guidelines often misleading, study finds]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[<b>By Dennis Thompson</b><br><i>HealthDay Reporter</i>]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>MONDAY, Aug. 22, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Parents should take industry television ratings with a grain of salt, since they don't always reflect the true amount of violence, smoking and drinking in TV shows, a new study warns.</p>

<p>Shows approved for children 7 and older (TV-Y7) contain nearly as much violence as shows intended for adults only, said lead researcher Joy Gabrielli. She is a clinical child psychologist at Dartmouth College's Geisel School of Medicine in Hanover, N.H.</p>

<p>In addition, shows rated for preteens and teenagers displayed just as much smoking and drinking as adult-rated shows, according to the study.</p>
 
<p>"When you think about who's going to be watching shows rated TV-PG and TV-14, it's going to be preteens and early adolescents," Gabrielli said. "Those are the folks who we worry about most when it comes to initiation of substance use behavior."</p>

<p>Only sex and gory violence appeared to be appropriately reflected in the ratings from the TV Parental Guidelines Monitoring Board, the industry-supported group charged with reviewing and rating TV shows, Gabrielli said.</p>

<p>"Our paper is meant to be a cautionary tale to parents about the ratings," she said.</p>

<p>The monitoring board responded to the study by citing a recent nationwide survey that showed most parents are aware of and understand the ratings system.</p>

<p>"The survey results showed that the ratings are viewed favorably by nearly four out of five parents and 77 percent of parents use the ratings system, an increase from similar studies conducted in 2014 and 2011," said Missi Tessier, spokeswoman for the board's executive secretariat. "Additionally, some 96 percent of parents polled said they were satisfied with the accuracy of the parental ratings for shows on television."</p>

<p>The TV industry created the parental guidelines in 1996, under pressure from Congress to protect children from depictions of sex and violence on television, researchers said in background notes. Ratings appear in the upper left corner of the screen at the start of TV shows.</p>

<p>To assess the accuracy of the ratings, Gabrielli and her colleagues reviewed 323 episodes of 17 television shows, coding them for risk behaviors, such as violence, sex, and smoking or alcohol use. The shows were rated TV-Y7, TV-PG, TV-14 or TV-MA (for mature audiences).</p>

<p>"We know from prior research that youth exposure to risk behavior in the media accounts for some of the explanation of how they develop those risk behaviors over time," Gabrielli said. Media can play a role in kids picking up bad habits and escalating their risky behavior.</p>

<p>Seven shows were chosen because they were most popular with youth, based on Nielsen ratings. The shows included: Dirty Jobs (TV-14); Family Guy (TV-14); Fresh Prince of Bel Air (TV-PG); SpongeBob SquarePants (TV-Y7); The Fairly OddParents (TV-Y7); South Park (TV-MA); and Zoey 101 (TV-Y7).</p>

<p>The researchers also selected 10 other shows that were very likely to display risky behaviors, to compare them against kid-oriented shows. These included: 30 Rock (TV-14); Burn Notice (TV-PG); Californication (TV-MA); Desperate Housewives (TV-14); Entourage (TV-MA); Friday Night Lights (TV-PG); Mad Men (TV-14); The Hills (TV-PG); True Blood (TV-MA); and Weeds (TV-MA).</p>

<p>Violence was pervasive across all of the ratings categories, appearing in seven out of every 10 episodes evaluated, the researchers reported. The only show with no violence was Dirty Jobs.</p>

<p>Overall, alcohol use occurred in 58 percent of episodes, and smoking in 31 percent, the study found. While there was virtually no drinking or smoking in TV-Y7 shows, there was little difference in those behaviors between shows rated TV-PG, TV-14 or TV-MA, Gabrielli said.</p> 

<p>"If you're a parent with a 13-year-old, you'll want to pay very close attention to the content of the show your kid is watching," she said. "It might be the show is teaching them appropriate behavior, and it might be the show is teaching them really inappropriate behavior."</p>

<p>Gabrielli said the monitoring board could improve the accuracy of its ratings by screening shows more closely and by expanding its definition of violence.</p>

<p>"They're really good at defining gory violence, but there might be other types of interpersonal violence that are still pretty significant but aren't weighing as much on the ratings systems," she explained.</p>

<p>Parents worried about their kids' media exposure also should consider other sources of information, including other parents, said Scott Campbell, an assistant professor of communication studies with the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.</p>

<p>"For example, Common Sense Media offers a space where parents view and contribute ratings and comments about shows, much like product reviews on sites like Amazon," Campbell said. "These insights can be just as useful, if not more so, than television's self-regulatory system."</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[To Keep Teens Slim, Focus on Health not Weight]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[New American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines cover preventing obesity <i>and</i> eating disorders]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[<b>By Amy Norton</b><br><i>HealthDay Reporter</i>]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>MONDAY, Aug. 22, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- When teenagers are overweight, parents and doctors should encourage a healthy lifestyle rather than worry about the number on the bathroom scale, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) says.</p>

<p>In new guidelines that address both teen obesity and eating disorders, the AAP says adults should move away from "weight talk," and instead help kids have a healthy relationship with food and their bodies.</p>

<p>"We need to focus on health and healthy behaviors, rather than the number on the scale," said Dr. Neville Golden, the lead author of the new recommendations. He is a professor of pediatrics at Stanford University's School of Medicine in California.</p>

<p>The AAP has long had guidelines on both childhood obesity and eating disorders. But the new report addresses both together because they are connected, Golden said.</p>

<p>Most teenagers diagnosed with eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia were not overweight to begin with, according to Golden. But, he said, some overweight teens do develop eating disorders when they try to lose weight.</p>

<p>In an effort to shed pounds, Golden said, some kids turn to risky tactics such as fasting, using diet pills and laxatives, or excessive exercise.</p>

<p>To help ward off those problems, parents and doctors should steer teenagers away from the idea of "dieting," the AAP said.</p>

<p>One reason is that dieting doesn't work, Golden pointed out. Studies have shown that teens who go on diets are more likely than their peers to become overweight.</p>

<p>What's more, Golden said, dieting can go too far -- with kids severely limiting calories or using other unhealthy weight-loss tactics.</p>

<p>And part of the concern, he noted, is that overweight teens who develop eating disorders can be easy to miss -- because they're not excessively thin.</p>

<p>But kids who rapidly lose weight can develop complications often seen in anorexia --  such as an unstable heart rate and low blood pressure, the AAP warned.</p>

<p>Marjorie Nolan Cohn is a New York City-based registered dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.</p>

<p>She agreed with the overall message of the AAP guidelines, which were published online Aug. 22 in <i>Pediatrics.</i></p>

<p>"Having kids go on a 'diet' isn't going to help," Cohn said.</p>

<p>What does help, she said, is ensuring the kitchen is stocked with healthy foods, having family meals whenever possible, and encouraging kids to have a positive body image.</p>

<p>How can parents promote a healthy body image? For one, they can be mindful of their words, both Golden and Cohn said.</p>

<p>It might seem "obvious" that family members shouldn't tease or criticize kids about their weight, Cohn noted. "Unfortunately," she said, "a lot of people don't realize that."</p>

<p>And it's not only what parents say about their kids that matters. "What you say about yourself and other people is important, too," Golden said.</p>

<p>Cohn agreed. "If kids hear their mom saying nasty things about her own body, they do take that in," she said.</p>

<p>Instead of commenting on kids' weight, the AAP said, parents and doctors should talk about the importance of a balanced diet and getting regular exercise.</p>

<p>But, it should also go beyond a conversation. Parents should "lead by example," Golden said, and take a look at their own lifestyle habits.</p>

<p>The AAP recommended having family meals as often as possible. That's because studies have found that kids who sit down to eat with their family tend to eat more healthy foods, and are less likely to diet or take "extreme" measures to lose weight.</p>

<p>"We don't really know why family meals are beneficial," Golden said. "It may be because parents are 'modeling' healthy eating. Or maybe it gives parents and kids a chance to talk, which is important, too."</p>

<p>Cohn made another point: "At a typical office visit, your pediatrician may have about 30 seconds to give some general diet advice."</p>

<p>Yet kids who have issues with weight or unhealthy eating habits often have parents who are in the same boat. So if parents need additional help, she said, they can ask their doctor for a referral to a registered dietitian.</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Too Few Female Urologists to Meet Aging Patients' Demand]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[Women prefer female doctors, but urology has one of the largest gender gaps in medicine, researchers say]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>MONDAY, Aug. 22, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Women prefer to see female urologists, but there are far too few to meet a growing demand, a new study reports.</p>

<p>Researchers analyzed patient data from 2003 to 2012 for more than 6,000 urologists across the United States. Women represented 54 percent of patients for female urologists, and 32 percent for male urologists, the study found.</p>

<p>Of an estimated 9,600 U.S. urologists, between 8 percent and 12 percent are women, according to the study.</p>

<p>"Every day in my practice I hear women say, 'Oh, I'm so glad you're here. It has taken me a long time to find a woman in this field,'" said study senior author Dr. Sarah Flury. She is an assistant professor of urology at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine.</p>

<p> "In some smaller cities, there isn't a single female urologist," Flury said. </p>

<p>The number of female urologists did increase from 34 in 1981 to 512 in 2009, and the percentage of female urology residents rose from 5 percent in 1989 to 23 percent in 2011.</p>

<p>"The field has been lacking in gender equality," Flury said in a university news release. "There is an unmet need." </p>

<p>As they age, more women are seeing urologists, and a main reason is incontinence. The stigma around the condition has eased, and more women are seeking treatment for it, the researchers explained.</p>

<p>The study's lead author, Dr. Daniel Oberlin, chief urology resident at Feinberg, said, "In many medical specialties there is a discrepancy between men and women in the field, but urology has one of the largest gender disparities." </p>

<p>The study looked particularly at gender-neutral surgeries -- procedures that are not specific to men or women. It found that female urologists perform a larger share of these surgeries on female patients than male urologists do. </p>

<p>"We often assume that a physician's training, experience and expertise may influence the type of patients they treat, yet this is the first time we have shown that a surgeon's gender alone will shape the gender of patients they see in clinic," Oberlin said in the news release.</p>

<p> More women must be encouraged to pursue urology, he added. "The misconception is urology tends to deal with male issues, but we deal with the kidneys, bladder and entire urinary tract -- a lot of organs that affect women," Oberlin said.</p> 

<p>The report was published online recently  in the <i>Journal of Urology</i>. </p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Family Trumps Friends in Extending Seniors' Lives]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[People are comfortable expecting more help from relatives, researchers say]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[<b>By Steven Reinberg</b><br><i>HealthDay Reporter</i>]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<!--Spanish ID: 714112 -->
<p>SUNDAY, Aug. 21, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Among older folks, close family relationships appear more important than dear friends in extending life, a new study finds.</p>

<p>Older adults who were extremely close with family other than spouses had about a 6 percent risk of dying within the next five years, compared with about 14 percent among those who said they were not close to their family, the researchers discovered.</p>

<p>"Social relationships really do matter," said lead researcher James Iveniuk, a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Toronto School of Public Health.</p>

<p>But family relationships seem more vital than friendships. "You can be close to your friends, but it didn't have a big effect, but if you were not close to your family, you were at greater risk of dying," he said.</p>

<p>In particular, people not close to their family had a greater risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke, Iveniuk said.</p>

<p>Family appears to be more important than friends because of what people  expect from family, he said.</p>

<p>"There are strong expectations about your family taking care of you, particularly when things are burdensome or frightful for you, like when you are in ill health -- your family is supposed to be there for you," Iveniuk explained.</p>

<p>In contrast, friends are more likely to move in and out of your network, especially if you are not easy to be around, he said.</p>

<p>"This is not to say that family is always better for you," Iveniuk said. Lots of cases exist where family is burdensome, frustrating or even abusive, and you should not associate with them just because they're family, he said.</p>

<p>"But for most people, most of the time, family are people with whom you are most likely to be close and more likely to be open about things like your health, and [they] are potentially people who postpone the death of individuals they are close to," Iveniuk said.</p>

<p>The findings were to be presented Sunday at the American Sociological Association annual meeting, in Seattle. Research presented at meetings is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p>

<p>One expert thinks that the definition of family needs to be expanded beyond blood or relationships by marriage.</p>

<p>"The concept of family is ever evolving," said Dr. Gisele Wolf-Klein, director of geriatric education at Northwell Health in Great Neck, N.Y.</p>

<p>For many people, long-term friends are more family than relatives are, she explained.</p>

<p>"Many of my patients who are in their 80s and 90s have a new family because they divorce," Wolf-Klein said. "Many of my patients get into a relationship which is not formalized, and it is not uncommon to move from a traditional family setting to a different type of family, such as a homosexual or transgender situation," she said.</p>

<p>In the study, Iveniuk and his colleague L. Philip Schumm, a senior biostatistician at the University of Chicago, used national data to look for the most important social networks for postponing death.</p>

<p>Older adults were asked to list up to five of their closest confidants, describe in detail the nature of each relationship and indicate how close they felt to each person. </p>

<p>Excluding spouses, participants had an average of three close confidants, and most said they had high levels of support from their social contacts. Most participants were married, in good health and said they were not very lonely, the researchers found.</p>

<p>The investigators also found that those who listed more non-spousal family members in their network, regardless of closeness, had lower odds of early death compared with those who listed fewer family members. </p>

<p>In addition, the researchers noted four factors associated with a lower risk of early death. These were being married, having a large network of friends and family, participating in social organizations, and feeling closer to one's confidants.</p>

<p>Factors that were less important included time with confidants, access to social support, and feelings of loneliness, Iveniuk said.</p>

<p>The meaning of the association between family and life span is uncertain, said Dr. David Katz, director of the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center in Derby, Conn., and president of the American College of Lifestyle Medicine.</p>

<p>"It may be that people who are close to their relatives have more loving support in their life. It may be that those who are not close to relatives have more strife, or are less adaptable. This kind of study cannot prove cause and effect, but serves to highlight an association of apparent importance," he said.</p>

<p>SUNDAY, Aug. 21, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Are certain times of the year harder on a marriage?</p>

<p>Maybe, suggests new research that found Americans are more likely to file for divorce after winter and summer holidays. And, that's true even though many couples view the holidays as a time when things might get better, the researchers said.</p>

<p>"People tend to face the holidays with rising expectations, despite what disappointments they might have had in years past. They represent periods in the year when there's the anticipation or the opportunity for a new beginning, a new start, something different, a transition into a new period of life. It's like an optimism cycle, in a sense," researcher Julie Brines, an associate professor of sociology from the University of Washington, said in a university news release.</p>

<p>"They're very symbolically charged moments in time for the culture," she added.</p>

<p>However, holidays can be stressful and emotionally charged for struggling couples and widen fissures in their marriage. So when holidays don't meet expectations, people may file for divorce, Brines said.</p>

<p>Researchers analyzed divorce filings in Washington state between 2001 and 2015 and found that they consistently peaked in March and August.</p>

<p>The results suggest that family holidays may influence when people file for divorce, the researchers said. Winter and summer holidays are important for many families and filing for divorce at that time may be considered inappropriate.</p>

<p>The study was to be presented Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association in Seattle. Findings presented at meetings are generally viewed as preliminary until they've been published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p>

<p>SATURDAY, Aug. 20, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Twitter and other social media are erasing a 20th century taboo against discussing death and mourning in public, researchers report.</p>

<p>Doctoral students in sociology at the University of Washington in Seattle reviewed the feeds of 39 dead Twitter users. They found that people used Twitter to react in a way that differed from other social media sites.</p>

<p>For example, Facebook posts about deaths tend to be more personal and involve people who knew the dead person. But Twitter users may not have known the dead person and tend to make both personal and general comments about him or her. They also may link the death to social issues such as mental illness or suicide.</p>

<p>"It's bringing strangers together in this space to share common concerns and open up conversations about death in a way that is really unique," doctoral candidate Nina Cesare said in a university news release.</p>

<p>She and colleague Jennifer Branstad concluded that Twitter was used "to discuss, debate and even canonize or condemn" the dead users.</p>

<p>Some users shared memories or said how they missed the dead person, others offered their thoughts on life and death, and some made judgmental comments. The most common known causes of death among the dead users were suicide, automobile accidents and shootings, they said.</p>

<p>"Ten, twenty years ago, death was much more private and bound within a community. Now, with social media, we're seeing some of those hierarchies break down in terms of who feels comfortable commenting about the deceased," Branstad said.</p>

<p>Cesare said new norms for what is appropriate and what is inappropriate to share must be established. </p>

<p>"But," she added, "I think the ability of Twitter to open the mourning community outside of the intimate sphere is a big contribution, and creating this space where people can come together and talk about death is something new."</p>

<p>The study was to be presented Sunday at the American Sociological Association annual meeting in Seattle. Research presented at meetings is typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p>

<p>SATURDAY, Aug. 20, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Cyberbullying among teens is highly likely to involve current or former friends and dating partners, a new study finds.</p>

<p>Researchers analyzed data from a 2011 survey of nearly 800 students in grades 8 through 12 at a public school in a New York City suburb. About 17 percent had been involved with cyberbullying in the previous week, the study found.</p>

<p>Nearly 6 percent of those students were victims; about 9 percent were aggressors; and about 2 percent were both. Cyberbullying usually occurred through Facebook or texting, the study authors said.</p>

<p>Girls were twice as likely as boys to be victimized. The risk of cyberbullying was seven times higher among current or former friends and dating partners than among those who had never been friends or dated, according to the study. </p>

<p>"A common concern regarding cyberbullying is that strangers can attack someone, but here we see evidence that there are significant risks associated with close connections," lead author Diane Felmlee said in an American Sociological Association news release.</p>

<p>Felmlee, a professor of sociology at  Pennsylvania State University, called "the large magnitude of the effects of close relationships on the likelihood of cyberbullying" surprising. </p>

<p>"We believe that competition for status and esteem represents one reason behind peer cyberbullying. Friends, or former friends, are particularly likely to find themselves in situations in which they are vying for the same school, club, and/or sport positions and social connections," she explained.</p>

<p>"In terms of dating partners, young people often have resentful and hurt feelings as a result of a breakup, and they may take out these feelings on a former partner via cyber aggression. They might also believe they can win back a previous boyfriend or girlfriend, or prevent that person from breaking up with them or dating someone else, by embarrassing or harassing him or her," Felmlee suggested.</p>

<p>The report was published in the September issue of the journal <i>Social Psychology Quarterly</i>.</p>

<p>The findings were also presented Saturday during the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association  in Seattle.</p>
